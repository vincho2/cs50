Description of how I chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap:
I used Bootstrap mainly for CSS classes like sticky-top, navbar, justify-content-end and also include an accordion, it was also used to have nice forms
I used Javascript to include a contact form on my main page, display the remaining characters count, an alert once the form is sent and a display of the data sent on the browser consol.
