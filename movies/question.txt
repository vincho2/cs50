In 13.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which
Kevin Bacon also starred.
    Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
    There may be multiple people named Kevin Bacon in the database. Be sure to only select the
    Kevin Bacon born in 1958.
    Kevin Bacon himself should not be included in the resulting list.
