Listener has an average energy of 0.65, an average valence of 0.48 and an average danceability of 0.72.
that's an average of 0.62 of the 3 metrics.
Overall, I would say that this listener is a bit above average in terms of audio aura.
However, it's only assuming that songs uses the full scale from 0 to 1 and are evenly spread over the scale.
It's also assuming that each of the 3 metrics have the same weight in the calculation.
It would also be worth comparing this figure with other listener and to rank them to see where this listener stands compared to others.
